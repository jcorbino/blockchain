# blockchain
Basic blockchain implemented in python 3 :)

Don't forget that a blockchain is just a data structure. Specifically, an immutable, ordered, back-linked list of blocks (blocks where we can store anything). That's it! It is not a ledger, it is not a technology, and it is certainly not the cure for cancer!
